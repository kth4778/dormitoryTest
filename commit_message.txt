sets up the basic login and signup pages on the frontend.

Backend changes:

- Integrated Spring Security with JWT for authentication and authorization.
- Added CORS configuration to allow frontend requests.

Frontend changes:
- Set up React Router for navigation.
- Integrated Redux Toolkit for state management (authSlice for user authentication).
- Created LoginPage and SignUpPage components with basic forms and styling.
- Enhanced error handling in authSlice to better manage API responses.
